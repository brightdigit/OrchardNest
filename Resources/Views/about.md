# OrchardNest

**OrchardNest is a site built by Leo Dion and dedicated to the Swift and Apple Developer community by providing a source for news, tutorials, podcasts, YouTube videos, and other updates.**

**Based on the wonderful [iOS Dev Directory by Dave Verwer](https://iosdevdirectory.com)**, this aggreates, filters, curates the variety of RSS feeds availables from [developers](/development), [designers](/design), [podcasters](/podcasts), [youtubers](/youtube) and [newsletters](/newsletters). 

If I am missing a site I highly recommend checking out Dave's [guidence on how to add a site](https://iosdevdirectory.com/contributing/). My hope is that this site continues to grow and helps developers stay informed about the Apple ecosystem and Swift.

If you have any other questions, check out our [support and FAQ page](/support) for more details.

## <i class="el el-smiley"></i> About Leo 

![](/images/leo.jpeg)

**Hi! My name is Leo Dion.** I have been doing software development for over 20 years. I have focused on Apple platforms and Swift for at least 10 years. I love developing in Swift and [I run my own company, BrightDigit](https://brightdigit.com) doing freelance Swift development and consulting. I build apps for the iPhone and iPad but also I love the Mac and Apple Watch as well. Recently I have enjoyed building
server-side solutions like this in Swift with Vapor.

Besides [my company](https://brightdigit.com), I run [a podcast, EmpowerApps.Show](https://empowerapps.show), a [development blog at learningswift.brightdigit.com](https://learningswift.brightdigit.com) and speak at conferences frequently about life, career, dev work and of course ... Swift.

**Please reach out to [me](http://twitter.com/leogdion) if you have any questions.**
